# csgoautorecord
Automatically records a demo of every match of *Counter-Strike 2* (formerly *Counter-Strike: Global Offensive*) you play. Why this isn't an option in the game itself like in *Team Fortress 2* is beyond me.

This is just a little toy project of mine. **No support will be provided.** This is not the most well written code. My git commit descriptions are not up to my usual standards. I don't care.

This probably won't get you VAC banned, as it just uses RCON and does not tamper with the game process or executables. However, use at your own risk anyway.
